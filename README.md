# Super Intelligent Chatbot with DialoGPT-large

This project demonstrates a conversational AI built using the state-of-the-art pre-trained [DialoGPT-large](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/DialoGPT-large) model from Hugging Face. The chatbot uses deep learning to generate context-aware responses.

## Features

- **Advanced Conversational AI:** Leverages deep learning for dynamic and context-aware responses.
- **Context Handling:** Maintains conversation history for coherent interactions.
- **Simple CLI Interface:** Interact with the chatbot via the command line.

## Installation

Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install transformers torch
```

## Note:
On the first run, the DialoGPT-large model (~1.5GB of data) will be downloaded automatically. Ensure you have a stable internet connection.

## How It Works
Model Loading: Downloads and loads the pre-trained DialoGPT-large model and its tokenizer from Hugging Face.
Context Handling: Each user input is appended to the conversation history, enabling context-aware response generation.
Response Generation: The model processes the conversation context and produces a dynamic response.

## Additional Notes
Data Download: The first time you run this script, approximately 1.5GB of model data will be downloaded.
Enhancements: For even more "intelligent" behavior, consider integrating additional modules (e.g., external knowledge bases, sentiment analysis, or fine-tuning on your specific domain).
